# Letter frequencies
Simple program used to illustrate performance problems. You should be able to optimize this program to run about twice as fast.

### Profiler
We used the profiler to try and analyze where there could be some problems in 

### Benchmarking
I am benchmarking the application by running the algorithm 100 times and then take the total time and divide it with 100.
This way around we should be sure to get a fair result with the CPU speeding up etc.
